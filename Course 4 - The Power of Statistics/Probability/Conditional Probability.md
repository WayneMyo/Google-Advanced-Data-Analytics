* Conditional probability refers to the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.
* Dependence:
    * Two events are dependent if the occurrence of one event changes the probability of the other event.
* Conditional Probability Formula:
    * For two dependent events, the probability of event A and event B occurring equals the probability of event A times the probability of event B given A.
    * Notation: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)
    * Also can be expressed as: P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)
* Examples:
    * Example 1: Drawing an ace from a deck of cards twice in succession:
        * P(A) (Ace on first draw): 4/52
        * P(B|A) (Ace on second draw given Ace on first): 3/51
        * Resultant probability of both: 4/52 * 3/51 ≈ 1/221
    * Example 2: Getting accepted into college and receiving a scholarship:
        * P(A) (Getting accepted): 10/100
        * P(B|A) (Getting scholarship given acceptance): 2/100
        * Resultant probability of both: 10/100 * 2/100 = 1/500
