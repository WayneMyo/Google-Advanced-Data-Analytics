* Three basic rules of probability: 
    * Complement Rule
    * Addition Rule
    * Multiplication Rule
* Probability notation:
    * P(A) represents the probability of event A.
    * P(A') represents the probability of event A not occurring.
* Complement Rule:
    * The complement of an event is the event not occurring.
    * Probability of an event happening and it not happening must add up to 1.
    * P(A') = 1 - P(A)
* Addition Rule (applicable to mutually exclusive events):
    * Mutually exclusive events cannot occur at the same time.
    * If events A and B are mutually exclusive, the probability of either A or B happening is the sum of their probabilities.
    * P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) 
* Multiplication Rule (applicable to independent events):
    * Independent events are those where occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.
    * If events A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B happening is the product of their probabilities.
    * P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)
* The Addition Rule applies to mutually exclusive events, while the Multiplication Rule applies to independent events.
