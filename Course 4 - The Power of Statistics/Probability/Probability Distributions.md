* **Probability distributions** are used to model different kinds of data sets and to identify significant patterns.
    * They describe the likelihood of the possible outcomes of a random event.

* **Random variables** represent the values for the possible outcomes of a random event.
    * Two types of random variables: discrete and continuous.

* **Discrete random variables** have a countable number of possible values.
    * These are often whole numbers that can be counted (e.g., the number of times a die lands on two).

* **Continuous random variables** take all the possible values in some range of numbers.
    * These values are not countable (e.g., all decimal values between one and two).
    * Examples of continuous variables include height, weight, time, and temperature.

* **Discrete distributions** represent discrete random variables.
    * Once you know the sample space of a random variable, you can assign probabilities to each of the possible values.
    * An example of a discrete probability distribution is a single die roll with six possible outcomes.

* **Continuous distributions** represent continuous random variables.
    * These distributions can only tell you the probability that the variable takes on a range of values.
    * An example of a continuous probability distribution is the height of an oak tree in a nearby forest.

* Probability distributions can be displayed as tables or graphs.
    * For a **discrete probability**, the random variable is plotted along the x-axis, and the corresponding probability is plotted along the y-axis.
    * For a **continuous probability**, the x-axis refers to the value of the variable being measured, and the y-axis refers to something called probability density.
