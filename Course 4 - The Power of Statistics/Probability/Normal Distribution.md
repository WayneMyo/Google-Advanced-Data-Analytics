* The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical on both sides of the mean, often referred to as the bell curve or Gaussian distribution.
* The x-axis of a normal distribution refers to the value of the variable you're measuring and the y-axis refers to the likelihood of observing that value.
* All normal distributions share the following features:
    * The shape is a bell curve.
    * The mean is at the center of the curve.
    * The curve is symmetrical on both sides of the center.
    * The total area under the curve equals 1.
* The distance of a data point from the mean is often measured in standard deviations. The standard deviation measures the spread of data around the mean.
* The empirical rule applies to normal distributions, stating:
    * 68% of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean.
    * 95% of values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.
    * 99.7% of values fall within three standard deviations of the mean.
* Values more than three standard deviations from the mean are typically considered outliers.
* The empirical rule can be used to estimate the distribution of values in a data set and identify potential outliers.
