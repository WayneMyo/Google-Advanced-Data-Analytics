* A z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is from the population mean. It indicates how far from the mean a data point is.
    * A z-score of 0 indicates a value equal to the mean.
    * A positive z-score indicates a value greater than the mean.
    * A negative z-score indicates a value less than the mean.
* Z-scores help in standardizing data, which involves putting different variables on the same scale. This process allows comparison of scores from different datasets that might have different units, mean values, and standard deviations.
* A standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Z-scores are based on this standard normal distribution.
* Z-scores are often used in anomaly detection to identify outliers in datasets.
* Z-score formula: Z = (X - μ) / σ
    * Z = Z-score
    * X = Individual data point
    * μ = Population mean
    * σ = Population standard deviation
* Example calculation: 
    * Given: Test score = 133, mean score = 100, standard deviation = 15
    * Z-score = (133 - 100) / 15 = 2.2 (meaning the test score is 2.2 standard deviations above the mean).
* Z-scores provide insight on how an individual value compares to the rest of the distribution.
