* Probability deals with uncertainty or measures the likelihood of an event occurring.
* Examples often used in probability include flipping coins, rolling dice, and drawing cards because they have clearly defined outcomes and are easy to understand.
* The probability that an event will occur is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
    * Probability = 0, there's a zero percent chance of the event.
    * Probability = 1, there's a 100 percent chance of the event.
    * Probability = 0.5, there is a 50 percent chance of the event.
* Probability measures the likelihood of random events, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted with certainty. These are known as random experiments or statistical experiments.
    * Random experiments have three things in common: 
        1. More than one possible outcome.
        2. Each possible outcome can be represented in advance.
        3. The outcome depends on chance.
* To calculate the probability of a random event, divide the number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.
    * E.g., the probability of tossing a coin and getting heads is 1 divided by 2 equals 0.5 or 50 percent.
    * E.g., the probability of choosing a green marble from a jar of 10 different colored marbles is 3 (green ones) divided by 10 (total) equals 0.3 or 30 percent.
