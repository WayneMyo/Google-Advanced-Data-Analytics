* Probability measures and quantifies uncertainty, aiding in informed decision-making about uncertain outcomes.
* There are two main types of probability: objective and subjective.
* Objective probability is based on statistics, experiments, and mathematical measurements. It consists of two types:
    * Classical probability - based on formal reasoning about events with equally likely outcomes.
        * To calculate, divide the number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.
        * E.g., flipping a coin - chance of getting heads or tails is 50%.
    * Empirical probability - based on experimental or historical data, representing the likelihood of an event occurring based on previous results.
        * To calculate, divide the number of times a specific event occurs by the total number of events.
        * E.g., if 80 out of 100 people prefer strawberry ice cream, the empirical probability of preferring strawberry ice cream is 80%.
* Subjective probability is based on personal feelings, experience, or judgment and does not involve formal calculations or statistical analysis.
    * E.g., having a feeling that a certain horse will win a race.
* It's crucial to distinguish between subjective and objective probability when evaluating predictions or making decisions.
