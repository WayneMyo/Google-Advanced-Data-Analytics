* **Binomial Distribution** is a discrete probability distribution for events with only two outcomes, success or failure.
    * Assumes each event is independent and has the same probability of success.

* Success and failure are labels for convenience and must be mutually exclusive.
    * For instance, a coin toss can't result in both heads and tails.

* The binomial distribution is used in fields like medicine, banking, investing, and machine learning.
    * For instance, classifying whether a digital image of an animal is a cat or not.

* Binomial distribution represents a type of random event called a **binomial experiment**.
    * A binomial experiment consists of repeated trials, has only two outcomes, has the same probability of success, and each trial is independent.

* Example of a binomial experiment is the probability of customers returning an item to a store.
    * The number of customer visits are trials, return or not return are the outcomes, return is labeled as success, and each customer visit is independent.

* The **binomial distribution formula** helps to determine the probability of getting a certain number of successful outcomes in a certain number of trials.
    * The variables in the formula: k = number of successes, n = number of trials, p = probability of success on a given trial, n choose k = number of ways to obtain k successes in n trials.

* A binomial distribution can be visualized with a histogram.
    * The random variable is plotted along the x-axis and the corresponding probability is plotted along the y-axis.
