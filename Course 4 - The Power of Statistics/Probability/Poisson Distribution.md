* **Poisson Distribution** is a probability distribution that models the probability of a certain number of events occurring during a specific time period or in a specific space (distance, area, volume).
    * Derived by French mathematician Baron Simeon Denis Poisson in 1830.

* It is used to model data such as the expected number of calls per hour, visitors per hour for a website, customers per day at a restaurant, severe storms per month in a city etc.

* A **Poisson experiment** has the following attributes:
    * The number of events in the experiment can be counted.
    * The mean number of events that occurred during a specific time period is known.
    * Each event is independent.

* **Poisson distribution formula** calculates the probability that a certain number of events occur during a specific time period.
    * The variables in the formula: Lambda = mean number of events that occurred during a specific time period, k = number of events, e = constant equal to approximately 2.71828.

* A Poisson distribution can be visualized with a histogram.
    * The number of events is plotted along the x-axis and the corresponding probability is plotted along the y-axis.

* Use the **Poisson distribution** if given the average probability of an event happening for a specific time period and the goal is to find out the probability of a certain number of events happening in that time period.

* Use the **Binomial distribution** if given the exact probability of an event happening, and the goal is to find out the probability of the event happening a certain number of times in a repeated trial.
