* Measures of central tendency are values that represent the center of a dataset.
* There are three main measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode.
* The mean is the average value of a dataset, calculated by adding up all values and dividing by the number of values.
* The median is the middle value in a dataset when arranged in order from smallest to largest.
  * For an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
  * If outliers (values that greatly differ from the rest of the data) are present, the median is usually a better measure of the center than the mean.
* The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset, and is useful especially with categorical data.
  * A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or more than one mode.
