* There are two main types of statistical methods: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
* Descriptive statistics describe or summarize the main features of a dataset, providing quick understanding of a large amount of data.
* Two forms of descriptive statistics are visual aids (like graphs and tables) and summary stats (like mean, median, mode).
* Summary stats consist of measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, variance).
* Inferential statistics allow professionals to make inferences about a dataset based on a sample of the data.
* A 'population' in statistics refers to the entire set of elements of interest, while a 'sample' is a smaller subset drawn from that population.
* Samples should be representative of the population for reliable inferences.
* A 'parameter' is a characteristic of a population, while a 'statistic' is a characteristic of a sample.
* Inferential statistics use known sample statistics to estimate unknown population parameters.
