* Measures of dispersion are values that represent the spread of a dataset from its center.
* The two main measures of dispersion are the range and standard deviation.
* The range is the difference between the largest and smallest value in a dataset.
  * It provides a quick understanding of the overall spread, but is sensitive to extreme values.
* Standard deviation measures how spread out the values are from the mean of a dataset.
  * The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the values are.
* Variance is another measure of dispersion, which is the average of the squared difference of each data point from the mean. It is the square of the standard deviation.
* The spread of data can be visualized with distributions, where the mean is the peak and the standard deviation determines the spread.
* Calculating the standard deviation involves these steps:
  * Find the mean of the dataset.
  * For each value in the dataset, calculate the square of its distance to the mean.
  * Sum all these squared distances.
  * Divide the sum by the number of values in the dataset minus one (n-1 for a sample).
  * Take the square root of the result.
* Understanding standard deviation helps predict variations in data, useful in areas like weather forecasting, financial markets, etc.
