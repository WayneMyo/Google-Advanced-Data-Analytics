* Hypothesis tests are divided into two types: one-sample and two-sample.
* One-sample test is used to determine whether a population parameter is equal to a specific value.
* A one-sample z-test makes two assumptions: the data is a random sample of a normally-distributed population, and the population standard deviation is known.
* Steps for conducting a hypothesis test:
    * State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
    * Choose a significance level.
    * Find the p-value.
    * Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
* Null hypothesis is a statement that is assumed to be true unless there's convincing evidence to the contrary.
* Alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis.
* Significance level is the threshold at which you will consider results statistically significant.
* P-value is the probability of observing a result as or more extreme than the result observed when the null hypothesis is true.
* A test statistic shows how closely your observed data matches the distribution expected under the null hypothesis.
* Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a data point is.
* If p-value < significance level, reject the null hypothesis.
* If p-value > significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
