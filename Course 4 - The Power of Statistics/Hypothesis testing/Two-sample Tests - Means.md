* Two-sample t-test is used to determine if two population means are equal.
* Assumptions for the two-sample t-test:
    * The two samples are independent.
    * Data is randomly drawn from a normally distributed population.
    * The population standard deviation is unknown.
* T-test is typically used when the population standard deviation is unknown and needs to be estimated from the data.
* T-scores are used as the test statistic for a t-test, and they are based on the t-distribution.
* As sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution.
* Steps for conducting a two-sample t-test:
    1. State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
    2. Choose a significance level.
    3. Calculate the test statistic t (t = (X1_bar - X2_bar) / sqrt((S1^2 / n1) + (S2^2 / n2))).
    4. Calculate the p-value using the test statistic.
    5. If the p-value < significance level, reject the null hypothesis. If p-value > significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
* In a two-tailed test, the p-value corresponds to the area under the curve on both the left tail and the right tail of the distribution.
* If the result is not statistically significant, consider testing a different variable.
