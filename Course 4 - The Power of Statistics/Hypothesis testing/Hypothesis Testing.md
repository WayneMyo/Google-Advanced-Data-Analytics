* Hypothesis testing involves these steps:
    * State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
    * Choose a significance level.
    * Find the p-value.
    * Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

* Null Hypothesis (H0):
    * A statement that is assumed to be true unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary.
    * Typically assumes that there is no effect in the population and that your observed data occurs by chance.
    * Always includes an equality symbol (usually =, but sometimes ≤ or ≥).
    * Often includes phrases such as “no effect,” “no difference,” “no relationship,” or “no change.”

* Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):
    * A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis and is accepted as true only if there is convincing evidence.
    * Typically assumes that there is an effect in the population, and that your observed data does not occur by chance.
    * Always includes an inequality symbol (usually ≠, but sometimes < or >).
    * Often includes phrases such as “an effect,” “a difference,” “a relationship,” or “a change.”

* Type I error (false positive):
    * Occurs when you reject a null hypothesis that is actually true.
    * Probability of making a Type I error is represented by alpha (α).
    * Significance level, or alpha (α), represents the probability of making a Type I error. Typically set at 0.05, or 5%.

* Type II error (false negative):
    * Occurs when you fail to reject a null hypothesis which is actually false.
    * Probability of making a Type II error is represented by beta (β).
    * To reduce Type II error, you can increase your sample size or your significance level.

* Risks:
    * Type I error often leads to implementing changes that are unnecessary and ineffective, wasting valuable resources.
    * Type II error may result in missed opportunities for positive change and innovation.
