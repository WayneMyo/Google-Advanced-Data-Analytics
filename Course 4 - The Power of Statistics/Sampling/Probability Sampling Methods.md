* **Probability Sampling Methods**
    * **Simple Random Sampling**
        * Every member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.
        * Beneficial for their representativeness and avoidance of bias.
        * Drawback: Expensive and time-consuming for large samples; small samples may underrepresent certain groups.
    * **Stratified Random Sampling**
        * The population is divided into groups (strata), and members are randomly selected from each group.
        * This method helps ensure equal representation for all groups and allows for more precise conclusions about each stratum.
        * Drawback: Difficult to identify appropriate strata without thorough knowledge of the population.
    * **Cluster Random Sampling**
        * The population is divided into clusters; entire clusters are randomly selected.
        * Useful when each cluster reflects the population as a whole; helpful for large and diverse populations with clearly defined subgroups.
        * Drawback: It may be challenging to create clusters that accurately reflect the overall population.
    * **Systematic Random Sampling**
        * Population members are arranged in an ordered sequence. A starting point is randomly selected, and members are chosen at regular intervals.
        * Often representative of the population; quick and convenient if a complete list of the population is available.
        * Drawback: The size of the population needs to be known before the study, and hidden patterns in the sequence may bias the sample.
