* The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. This holds true for any population regardless of its distribution shape.
* As the sample size increases, the sample mean gets closer to the population mean. A sufficiently large sample size will have a sample mean roughly equal to the population mean.
* To apply the central limit theorem, certain conditions must be met:
  * Randomization: Every member in the population must have an equal chance of being chosen for the sample.
  * Independence: Sample values must be independent of each other.
  * 10%: The sample size should be no larger than 10% of the total population when drawn without replacement.
  * Sufficiently large sample size.
* The specific sample size needed depends on precision requirements and the shape of the population. A sample size of 30 is typically sufficient for bell-shaped or normal populations. For non-normal populations, larger sample sizes may be required.
* The central limit theorem allows estimation of population parameters such as the mean from a single sample. The specific sample size chosen depends on budget, time, resources, and the desired level of confidence in the estimate.
