* A statistic is a characteristic of a sample, and a parameter is a characteristic of a population.
* A point estimate uses a single value to estimate a population parameter.
* Sampling distribution is a probability distribution of a sample statistic.
* Sampling variability refers to how much an estimate varies between samples.
* The mean weight will vary randomly from sample to sample.
* Central Limit Theorem states that, if the sample is large enough, your sample mean will roughly equal the population mean.
* The standard deviation of a sample statistic is called the standard error. It measures the variability among all your sample means.
* A larger standard error indicates that the sample means are more spread out. A smaller standard error indicates that the sample means are closer together.
* The less standard error, the more likely it is that your sample mean is an accurate estimate of the population mean.
* The formula for calculating the standard error is: S divided by the square root of n, where S is the sample standard deviation and n is the sample size.
* As the sample size gets larger, the standard error gets smaller, and you can have more confidence in your estimates.
