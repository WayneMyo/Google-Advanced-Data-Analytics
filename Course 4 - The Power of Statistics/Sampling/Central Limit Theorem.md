* The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.
* As your sample size increases, the sample mean will be roughly equal to the population mean.
* There is no exact rule for how large a sample size needs to be for the central limit theorem to apply, but in general, a sample size of 30 or more is considered sufficient.
* The central limit theorem holds true for any population, regardless of the shape of its distribution.
* If the sample size is large enough, the sampling distribution will follow a normal distribution, even if the population has a skewed distribution.
* The mean of the sampling distribution gives an accurate estimate of the population mean.
* The shape of the sampling distribution increasingly resembles a bell curve as the sample size increases.
* The specific sample size chosen in practice will depend on factors like budget, time, resources, and the desired level of confidence for the estimate.
