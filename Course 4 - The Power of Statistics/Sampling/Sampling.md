* Statistics play a crucial role in data science, forming the basis for more advanced methods like hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
* Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from a population.
* A population in statistics can refer to any type of data including people, objects, events, measurements and more.
* Sampling process involves stages like choosing a target population, collecting data for your sample.
* Two main types of sampling methods: Probability sampling and non-probability sampling.
* Random sampling can help ensure that the sample is representative of the population.
* Bias in sampling can occur, such as under-coverage and non-response bias which can affect non-probability sampling methods.
* Sampling distributions are probability distributions for sample statistics, these are used to estimate the corresponding values for populations.
* Central Limit Theorem is used to estimate the population mean for different types of datasets.
* Python's SciPy stats module can be used to work with sampling distributions and make a point estimate of the population mean.
* Descriptive statistics summarize the main features of the dataset while inferential statistics use sample data to draw conclusions or make predictions about a larger population.
* Collecting a sample is faster, more practical, and less expensive than collecting data on every member of the population.
* A representative sample accurately reflects the characteristics of a population. If a sample is not representative, inferences made will not be reliable and predictions will not be accurate.
* The sampling process includes five steps: 1) Identifying the target population 2) Selecting the sampling frame 3) Choosing the sampling method 4) Determining the sample size 5) Collecting the sample data.
* The sampling frame is a list of all the items in the target population.
* Probability sampling uses random selection to generate a sample, while non-probability sampling is often based on convenience or the personal preferences of the researcher rather than random selection.
* The larger the sample size, the more accurate your predictions.
