* **Impact of Bias in Sampling**
    * **Convenience Sampling**
        * Members of a population that are easy to contact or reach are chosen.
        * Risk: Undercoverage bias, where some members of the population are inadequately represented.
    * **Voluntary Response Sampling**
        * Members of a population who volunteer to participate in a study make up the sample.
        * Risk: Nonresponse bias, with certain groups less likely to respond and potentially those who respond having stronger opinions.
    * **Snowball Sampling**
        * Initial participants recruit other participants for the study.
        * Risk: Sampling bias, as recruited participants may share similar, unrepresentative characteristics.
    * **Purposive Sampling**
        * Participants are selected based on the purpose of the study.
        * Risk: Exclusion of certain groups can lead to a bias as the sample might not be representative of the overall population.
* The key takeaway is the need to consider bias and fairness from data collection to conclusion presentation in order to maintain accuracy and representativeness.
