* A sampling distribution is a probability distribution of a sample statistic, and represents the possible outcomes for a sample statistic. 
* Sample statistics like the mean are used to estimate corresponding population parameters.
* The sampling distribution of the mean refers to the distribution of all sample means from repeated samples taken from the population.
* Due to sampling variability, the sample mean will vary from sample to sample.
* The distribution of sample means can be represented on a histogram. This is known as the sampling distribution of the mean.
* With an increase in the sample size, the mean of the sample data will get closer to the mean of the population. A large enough sample size provides a precise estimate of the population mean.
* Standard error is used to estimate how precisely the sample mean represents the population mean. It provides a measure of sampling variability.
* The standard error of the mean measures variability among all your sample means. Larger standard error indicates more variability, and a smaller standard error indicates less variability.
* The formula to calculate the estimated standard error of the sample mean is: s / âˆšn, where 's' is the sample standard deviation, and 'n' is the sample size.
* A larger sample size leads to a smaller standard error, making the sample mean closer to the population mean and improving the precision of the estimate.
* Sampling distributions are important for making proper statistical inferences as they describe the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic.
