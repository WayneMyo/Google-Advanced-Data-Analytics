* **Probability Sampling Methods**
    * **Simple Random Sampling**
        * Every member of a population has an equal chance of being chosen.
        * They're usually representative and tend to avoid bias.
        * Drawback: It's often expensive and time-consuming for large samples.
    * **Stratified Random Sampling**
        * Population is divided into groups, or strata, and members are randomly selected from each group.
        * Ensures representation from each group in the population.
        * Drawback: It can be difficult to identify appropriate strata without deep knowledge of the population.
    * **Cluster Random Sampling**
        * Population is divided into clusters and entire clusters are randomly selected.
        * Helpful for large and diverse populations with clearly defined subgroups.
        * Drawback: It may be difficult to create clusters that accurately reflect the overall population.
    * **Systematic Random Sampling**
        * Population members are put into an ordered sequence. A starting point is randomly selected, and members are chosen at regular intervals.
        * Often representative of the population. Quick and convenient if you have a complete list of the population.
        * Drawback: You need to know the size of the population to choose consistent intervals.
