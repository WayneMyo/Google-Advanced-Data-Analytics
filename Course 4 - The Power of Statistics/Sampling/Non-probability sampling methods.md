* **Non-probability Sampling Methods**
    * **Overview**
        * Non-probability sampling doesn't provide an equal chance of selection for all members of a population.
        * High risk of sampling bias.
        * Often less expensive and convenient.
        * Useful for exploratory studies due to limitations in resources.
    * **Convenience Sampling**
        * Members chosen based on ease of contact or reach.
        * Risk: Undercoverage bias - some members of the population inadequately represented.
    * **Voluntary Response Sampling**
        * Members volunteer to participate in a study.
        * Risk: Nonresponse bias - certain groups less likely to respond, potential for more extreme opinions.
    * **Snowball Sampling**
        * Initial participants recruit other participants.
        * Used when population is difficult to access.
        * Risk: Sampling bias - recruited participants might share unrepresentative characteristics.
    * **Purposive Sampling**
        * Participants are chosen based on the specific needs of the study.
        * Risk: Exclusion of certain groups can lead to a bias as sample might not represent overall population.
* The key takeaway is to consider bias and fairness from the beginning of data collection to the end.
