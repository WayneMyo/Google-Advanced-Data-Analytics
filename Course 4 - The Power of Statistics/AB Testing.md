* A/B testing is a statistical application used by businesses to make data-driven decisions.
* Companies use A/B testing to compare two versions of a web page, app, online ad, or marketing emails to find out which performs better.
* The changes tested can be small (like color, size, or location of a button) or major (such as overall layout or content).
* An example of A/B testing includes testing two versions of a website page to determine which results in more conversions (sales).
* In the test, version A (control) is the original webpage, and version B is the variant with the change you want to test.
* The test directs half of the users to version A and the other half to version B, and it runs for a set period.
* Once the test concludes, statistical analysis is performed on the results to find out which version resulted in better performance.
* The underlying statistical concepts involved in A/B testing include inferential statistics, sampling, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
* Inferential statistics allow you to make predictions and draw conclusions about a larger population based on a sample.
* Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from the population for the test. The sample size should be determined properly for accurate results.
* A confidence interval quantifies the uncertainty surrounding an estimate, allowing for informed decisions based on the test sample.
* Statistical significance refers to whether the difference between two tested versions is due to the implemented change or just random chance.
* Hypothesis testing helps to quantify whether the observed results are likely due to chance or if they are statistically significant.
* Knowledge of statistics enables proper design, execution, and interpretation of A/B tests.
