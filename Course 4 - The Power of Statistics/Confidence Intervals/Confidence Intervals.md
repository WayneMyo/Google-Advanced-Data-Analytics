* Confidence intervals are a method used by data professionals to express the uncertainty of an estimate.
* Confidence intervals and credible intervals are two primary ways of expressing uncertainty in statistics, where confidence intervals are used in frequentist statistics and credible intervals are used in Bayesian statistics.
* A confidence interval consists of a range of values that likely includes the true population parameter.
* Confidence intervals are often used instead of point estimates to convey the uncertainty of an estimate due to random sampling.
* The primary components of a confidence interval are the sample statistic (point estimate), the margin of error, and the confidence level.
* The margin of error represents the maximum expected difference between the population parameter and the sample estimate.
* The confidence level indicates the probability that the confidence interval contains the true population parameter. Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%.
* When constructing a confidence interval, you start with a point estimate, add and subtract the margin of error to get the range of the interval, and state the confidence level.
* Python's SciPy stats module can be used to construct confidence intervals for point estimates of population means.
* Misinterpretation of confidence intervals can lead to false conclusions; therefore, it is essential for data professionals to communicate their results and interpretation accurately.
* Confidence intervals can be used in various practical contexts, such as estimating sales revenue for a new product line, the percentage of website visitors who will click on an ad, or the mean weight of a population of penguins.
* The choice of the confidence level can be adjusted based on the desired accuracy of the estimate. However, 95% is a traditionally popular choice in many fields.
* Confidence intervals provide a more informed basis for decision-making as they provide a range of likely values instead of a single point estimate.
