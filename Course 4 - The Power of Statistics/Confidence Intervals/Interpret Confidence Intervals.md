* Confidence intervals are used to express the uncertainty of an estimation process.
* 95% confidence means that if you take repeated random samples from a population and construct a confidence interval for each sample using the same method, 95% of these intervals will capture the population mean.
* The 95% confidence level refers to the long-term success rate of the method.
* In practice, we usually take one random sample and generate one confidence interval, which may or may not contain the actual population mean.
* Common misinterpretations:
  * Misinterpretation 1: A 95% confidence interval means there is a 95% probability that the population mean falls within the constructed interval. This is incorrect. The population mean is a constant, not a random variable.
  * Misinterpretation 2: A 95% confidence interval indicates that 95% of all of the data values in the population fall within the interval. This is not necessarily true. A 95% confidence interval shows a range of values that likely includes the actual population mean, not necessarily a range that contains 95% of the data values.
  * Misinterpretation 3: A 95% confidence interval implies that 95% of all possible sample means fall within the range of the interval. This is also not necessarily true.
* It is crucial to correctly interpret confidence intervals to provide accurate and useful information to stakeholders.
