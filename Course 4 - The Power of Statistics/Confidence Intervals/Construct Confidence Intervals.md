* Confidence intervals are used to express the uncertainty of an estimate.
* The basic process to construct confidence intervals involves four steps:
  * Identify a sample statistic.
  * Choose a confidence level.
  * Find the margin of error.
  * Calculate the interval.
* Confidence intervals can be calculated for different parameters like proportions or means.

* For proportions:
  * The sample statistic is the observed proportion.
  * The standard error for the proportion is calculated by taking the square root of (sample proportion * (1 - sample proportion) / sample size).
  * The margin of error is calculated by multiplying the Z score (related to confidence level) by the standard error.
  * The interval is then calculated by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the sample statistic.

* For means:
  * The sample statistic is the observed mean.
  * The standard error for the mean is calculated by taking the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.
  * The margin of error is calculated in the same way as for proportions.
  * The interval is then calculated by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the sample statistic.

* Important considerations:
  * The higher the confidence level, the wider the confidence interval.
  * In real-world scenarios, the population standard deviation is often unknown and has to be estimated from the sample standard deviation.
  * Confidence intervals can help stakeholders make informed decisions based on accurate estimates.
