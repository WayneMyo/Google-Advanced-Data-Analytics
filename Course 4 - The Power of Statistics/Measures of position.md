* Measures of position determine the position of a value in relation to other values in a dataset.
* Measures of position include percentiles and quartiles.
* A percentile is the value below which a certain percentage of data falls.
    * E.g., a test score in the 75th percentile is higher than 75% of all test scores.
* Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts.
    * Q1 (First Quartile) - Middle value in the first half of the dataset, also called the lower quartile.
    * Q2 (Second Quartile) - Median value of the dataset.
    * Q3 (Third Quartile) - Middle value in the second half of the dataset, also known as the upper quartile.
* Quartiles and percentiles relate as follows: Q1 = 25th percentile, Q2 = 50th percentile, Q3 = 75th percentile.
* Calculation steps for quartiles:
    1. Arrange the values from smallest to largest.
    2. Find the median of your dataset (Q2).
    3. Find the median of the lower half of your dataset (Q1).
    4. Find the median of the upper half of your dataset (Q3).
* The middle 50% of your data is known as the interquartile range (IQR), which is the distance between Q1 and Q3.
* The five-number summary includes: minimum, Q1, median (Q2), Q3, and maximum.
* A boxplot visualizes the five-number summary, where the box goes from Q1 to Q3, the line in the middle of the box is the median, and the whiskers go from Q1 to the minimum value and from Q3 to the maximum value.
